## Features

- **Sensors**: Room temperature, WiFi signal strength, firmware version, IP address, current face
- **Binary Sensors**: Online status, alive status, firmware update available
- **Select**: Clock face (Off / Awake / Sleepy / Semi-Awake / Smiley), clock format (12h / 24h), music mode
- **Number**: Volume, noise alert threshold
- **Switch**: Per-alarm enable/disable toggles (one switch per alarm)
- **Lights**: Brightness (dimmable), app background color (RGB)
- **Alarm CRUD**: Create, update and delete alarms via HA services

---

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1 or newer
- An UrbanHello account (username + password from the Remi app)

---

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → **⋮** → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/timoa/ha-remi` as an **Integration**
4. Search for **Remi** and install it
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/urbanhello_remi_unofficial/` folder into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

---

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Remi**
3. Enter your UrbanHello account **username** and **password**
4. The integration will authenticate and discover your Remi device automatically

## Brightness migration

Brightness is now a dimmable `light`, using the same API `luminosity` setting
(0–100). The old `number` and the incorrectly labelled lux sensor are no longer
created. Previously registered entities may remain unavailable and can be removed
manually in Home Assistant. These obsolete entries are not automatically deleted
from the entity registry, and automation references are not rewritten. No ambient illuminance
sensor is provided.

Update automations that used `number.*_brightness` (or a renamed brightness
number) to target the new light entity shown on the REMI device page. Entity IDs
can differ between installations; the following IDs are examples only.

```yaml
# Previously
service: number.set_value
target:
  entity_id: number.example_brightness
data:
  value: 40
```

```yaml
# Now
service: light.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: light.example_brightness
data:
  brightness_pct: 40
```

Use `light.turn_off` to switch the upper light off. An unqualified `light.turn_on`
uses the current/last nonzero intensity, or 100% when none is known. The last
nonzero intensity is included in Home Assistant's restore data, so it can also
be restored after a restart while the light is off. Current nonzero API data takes
precedence over saved intensity. Missing, invalid or out-of-range API values make
the new light unavailable instead of inventing a brightness.

For state conditions, use the light's `on`/`off` state. For numeric conditions,
use its `brightness` attribute (0–255), not the old number's 0–100 state. A stored
reference to the old lux sensor must be removed or replaced with an actual
ambient light sensor. Historical values are not converted or reinterpreted.

## RGB entity changes

`App Background Color` changes the color associated with a REMI in the official
UrbanHello app. It remains an RGB `light` with the same unique ID, existing
entity ID and commands. Existing automations continue to target the same entity;
a user-defined display name is preserved by Home Assistant.

The former RGB `Night Light` entity has been removed. Commands to `lightnight`
had no observable physical effect on two tested REMIs running firmware 329 and
332. The field was initially absent on one device and appeared after RGB write
experiments. These observations do not establish hardware support on other
models. This integration no longer writes `lightnight` and does not delete or
reset existing values on UrbanHello's servers.

The obsolete Night Light entry may remain unavailable after an upgrade. Remove
it manually along with references in dashboards, scripts and automations, or
remove and re-add the integration if you do not need to retain its entities.
These obsolete light entries are not automatically deleted. The app background color
is not a replacement for a physical light.

## Alarm Services

Alarms are managed via HA services (callable from automations or Developer Tools → Services).

### `remi.create_alarm`

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Alarm label |
| `time` | ✅ | ISO 8601 datetime (e.g. `2026-02-20T07:00:00.000Z`) |
| `enabled` | — | Active/inactive (default: `true`) |
| `repeat` | — | Days to repeat: `[0=Sun, 1=Mon, …, 6=Sat]` |
| `face_define` | — | Face at alarm time (e.g. `FACE_DAY`) |
| `volume` | — | Volume override (0–100) |

### `remi.update_alarm`

Same fields as `create_alarm`, plus `event_id` (required) — the `objectId` of the alarm to update.

### `remi.delete_alarm`

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `event_id` | ✅ | The `objectId` of the alarm to delete |
